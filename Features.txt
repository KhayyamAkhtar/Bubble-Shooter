What works:
*Horizontal, Vertical and Diagonal bursting of balls
*Ball grid and roof collapsing downwards after fixed intervals
*Game over if balls touch the cannon area
*Level cleared if all balls cleared
*Random balls generated only of colors available in grid

What doesn't work:
*Sometimes diagonal bursting does not work
*Sometimes next level does not start after clearing the first level
